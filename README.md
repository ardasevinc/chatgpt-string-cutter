# Cut Strings Into Several Parts

This was created solely for the purpose of dividing a long string (**newline delimited**)
Into several parts that are up to 10k characters. Why? To prepare summaries
of long videos. Especially useful for course vids.

Optimized so that **you won't go over the token limit** of ChatGPT

### Usage

- Copy the transcript of a video or any newline delimited text
- Paste it into the app

## Development
